      <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Townsville. During year 11 I got a school-based Apprenticeship as a Heavy Vehicle Mechanic
        while finishing my remainder years of school.I went on to complete my Apprenticeship gaining a Cert 3 in Heavy Automotive and in 2015 I joined the
        Australian Army as a Vehicle Mechanic which gave me the opportunity to move around the country.</p>
      <p>Growing up I was big into playing sport mostly soccer, I played it for 10 years of my childhood.
         I stopped playing soccer when I started working full time as a Mechanic. As I got older my interest
         in Gaming grew (mostly online gaming) and now it is one of my main hobbies.</p>
      <p>Below is a picture of my gaming setup. I am currently running a Pryon desktop with dual monitors, Razer Naga Trinity mouse and a Razer Black widow keyboard. </p>

      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>Growing up technology has advanced and became a lot more of my everyday life, just about everything is done or can be done online. If I could go back knowing technology would be like this, then I would have chosen a career in IT after school.
         Towards the end of my Army career, I decided that I wanted a change of careers and since I spend a lot of time on computers and the way the world is going, I thought I would try and pursue a career in IT.
         I have very limited experience in IT but the main reason for wanting to do IT is to be able to fix and rectify tech problems around me.</P>
      <p>Transitioning out of the Army I had no knowledge on Uni whatsoever. I had spoken to a JCU representative at a transition seminar, and they were able to tell me what I needed to be able to study for a Bachelor of IT.
         I signed up with Open Universities Australia with the interest of studying for my Bachelor of IT and since I have no previous history of studying, they suggested that I try out a single subject to see what I think and how I go with it.
         I chose this course because it will help me with starting off my studies for the bachelor and I wanted to do this all online which is why I chose RMIT.</P>
      <p>Over the years I got used to being thrown in the deep end when it came to courses. However, this course started at a nice steady pace. Coming into this course I was expecting to
         learn the basics of how to identify and fix certain tech problems. If I can leave this course with a basic knowledge of IT and a better understanding of it all then I have achieved the goal that I wanted from this course.</p>

      <h1>Personality Profile</h1>
      <h2>Myers Briggs Type Indercator</h2>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <p>Creative - Advocates aren’t exactly like everyone else – and that’s a wonderful thing. People with this personality type embrace their creative side, always on the lookout for opportunities to express themselves and think outside the box.</p>
      <p>Insightful - These personalities know all too well that appearances can be misleading. Advocates strive to move beyond superficiality and seek out the deeper truths in life. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs.</p>
      <p>Principled - Advocates tend to have strong beliefs and values, particularly when it comes to matters of ethics. When Advocates talk about topics close to their heart, their conviction and heartfelt idealism can inspire and persuade even the sternest of skeptics.</p>
      <p>Passionate - Advocates crave a sense of purpose in life. Rather than living on autopilot or sticking to the status quo, they want to chase after their ideals. This isn’t a personality type that shies away from big dreams – in fact, Advocates are energized and impassioned by the beauty of their visions for the future.</p>
      <p>Altruistic - People with this personality type aren’t happy to succeed at another person’s expense. Advocates want to use their strengths for the greater good, and they rarely lose sight of how their words and actions might affect others. In their heart of hearts, they want to make the world a better place, starting with the people around them.</p>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <p>Sensitive to Criticism - Advocates aren’t averse to feedback – that is, unless they believe that someone is challenging their most cherished principles or values. When it comes to the issues that are near and dear to them, people with this personality type can become defensive or dismissive.</p>
      <p>Reluctant to Open Up - Advocates value honesty and authenticity, but they’re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles, not wanting to burden someone else with their issues. Unfortunately, when Advocates don’t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships.</p>
      <p>Perfectionistic - The Advocate personality type is all but defined by idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, it doesn’t always leave room for the messiness of real life. Advocates might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships if they’re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they should be looking for something better.</p>
      <p>Avoiding the Ordinary - Advocates yearn to do extraordinary things with their lives. But it’s hard to achieve anything extraordinary without breaking it down into small, manageable steps. Unless they translate their dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists, Advocates may struggle to turn their grand visions into reality.</p>
      <p>Prone to Burnout - Advocates’ perfectionism and reserve leave them with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type can exhaust themselves if they don’t balance their drive to help others with necessary self-care and rest.</p>

      <h2>Test Two</h2>
      <h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Auditory: 25%</li>
       <li>Visual: 55%</li>
       <li>Tactile: 20%</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visual</h3>
    <p>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.
       As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>

     <p>Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:
     <ul>
       <li>Sit near the front of the classroom.</li>
       <li>Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.</li>
       <li>Use flashcards to learn new words.</li>
       <li>Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.</li>
       <li>Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.</li>
       <li>Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.</li>
       <li>Colour code things.</li>
       <li>Avoid distractions during study times.</li></p>
     </ul>

     <h2>Test Three</h2>
     <h3>Team Role Test</h3>

     <h3>Your team roles</h3>
     <p>Your answers have been used to identify which team role(s) suits you best. This suitability is expressed as a percentage.
        The nine team roles are the Executive, Explorer, Innovator, Analyst, Driver, Chairperson, Completer, Team player and Expert.A total of 100 points are divided over the various roles. A group role can have up to 25 points. The graph below shows how each team role fits you. After the graph, each team role is explained in detail, in the order of its importance to you.</p>

     <p>Analyst - The analyst tends to be reserved and critical. The analyst will also react to plans and ideas in a rational and sensible way. He or she will favour a prudent approach to matters and will evaluate them according to their accuracy before acting.</p>
     <p>Executive - The executive is sometimes also referred to as the organizer. The executive is generally disciplined and eager to get the job done. He or she is efficient, practical, and systematic. Executives are well organized and diligent, and quickly turn the ideas of a team into concrete actions and practical plans.</p>
     <p>Innovator - The innovator is often the creative generator of a team. He or she has a strong imagination and a desire to be original. The innovator prefers to be independent and tends to approach tasks in a scientific way. As a creative individual the innovator may play a crucial role in the way a team approaches tasks and solves problems.</p>
     <p>Chairperson - The chairperson has a strong coordinating role. With an emphasis on procedures, the chairperson will try to bring and keep the team together. He or she is communicative and deals with the members of the team in a respectful and open-minded way.</p>
     <p>Explorer - The explorer is generally an extrovert by nature. He or she is cheerful, gregarious. The explorer is also investigative, interested and curious about things. Because explorers like to improvise and communicate with others, they will have little problem presenting ideas to the team and developing new contacts.</p>
     <p>Driver - The driver is generally very ambitious and energetic. He or she may appear as impatient and impulsive. The driver is a strong motivator and will challenge others at crucial times. Although the actions of the driver may sometimes seem somewhat emotional, they do play a crucial role in pushing the team forward to succeed.</p>
     <p>Completer - The completer is very conscientious and feels responsible for the team's achievements. Completers are concerned when errors are made, and they tend to worry because of their controlling nature. The completer is also known as the finisher because they are most effectively used at the end of a task, to polish and scrutinize the work for errors, subjecting it to the highest standards of quality control.</p>
     <p>Team player - The team player is caring, avoids conflicts, and fosters harmony. Being someone who likes to help other people, the team player is generally considered agreeable and friendly. He or she is diplomatic and emphasizes solidarity and team cohesion.</p>
     <p>Expert - The expert has the skills and expertise required for the specific task at hand. He or she has a strong focus on the task and may get defensive when others interfere with his or her work. The expert prefers to work alone, and team members often have a great deal of trust and confidence in him or her.</p>

    <h2>My Analysis</h2>
    <p>After completing and reviewing the results of these tests, I can say that I don’t agree with some of them. The Myer-Briggs results say that I’m introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and judging. Which you don’t realise until you see it on paper and what they are determined as, but I 100% agree with those results. The second test I only partially agree with, although I do learn well from watching how things are being done, I’ve always found that I learnt better from doing something myself.</p>
    <p>When it comes to being in a team, I wouldn’t be the one to put my hand up to be team leader, I’ve always tended to stay back observe and take on less priority roles.</p>
    <p>When forming a team, I should take this into account so that I am in a team that has someone that wants to take charge/lead rather than be forced into a stressful role because no one wants it. Its also good to keep in mind to not form a team with people that your personality clashes with.</p>

     <h1>Project Idea</h1>
     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>The project is to create a virtual reality multiplayer online role-playing game. This will provide a more realistic experience for gamers who play multiplayer online role-playing games and will revolutionise how we play online. The game that I would like to create would be based off the light novel and anime series Sword Art Online.</p>

     <h2>Motivation</h2>
     <p>I have a passion for playing multiplayer online role-playing games, the social aspect of it and just getting lost in a fantasy world where you can be and do just about anything. Ever since I saw the Anime Sword Art Online, I have always dreamed of one day being able to play a virtual reality multiplayer online role-playing game.It would be a great achievement to be part of the development for such a game. Currently to date there are around 3 billion people in the world that play video games, so I think something like this will be the next best thing.</p>

     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>To play the game you will need a Pimax Vision 5K Super VR headset which is compatible with thousands of VR games today and a PC to run it all. The game will be playable with a $30 monthly subscription. The game will consist of three Regions, Oceanic, North America and Europe. Given how popular World of Warcraft is there will be several servers implemented in each region to compensate for the vast number of players to be expected. The game will include an in-game shop where you will be able to purchase some services like faction change, race change and character transfers.</p>
     <p>The game will still take place in the world of Azeroth, having two continents: the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, with each continent split up into 10 different leveling zones. There will be two factions to choose from either Alliance or horde, both containing four races to choose from: humans, dwarves, gnomes, and night elves for the Alliance and orcs, trolls, tauren, and the Forsaken for the Horde to choose from and being able to pick one of the nine classes to play as. Amongst these classes you will be able to choose the role of Tank, Healer or Damage dealer. Each race will have a different starting zone and have their own capital city along with a king/war chief.</p>
     <p>There will be two types of game modes to choose from, Player vs Player and Player vs Environment. Player vs Player will not be activated while in the races starting zone and will activate once you hit level 10 regardless of where you are. You have the option to deactivate and activate the Player vs Player mode, but you must be in a Capital city to do so. You will be able to tell if someone has this mode activated by a crossed swords symbol next to their name and you can only attack someone of the opposing Faction.</p>
     <p>Once in game you will be able to start your adventure throughout Azeroth questing and leveling up. To begin with there will be a level cap at level 50, but once at level 50 you will gain access to end game content such as raids. Apart from end game raids you will have access to various dungeons throughout your travels as you level up. The first dungeon will be accessible at level 10 where you will be able to form a party with other players consisting of a tank, healer and 2 damage dealers. As you progress and level up you will unlock more dungeons to explore.</p>
     <p>The game will also have a regular maintenance schedule and be down once a week, this will allow for any updates and to rectify any issues at hand. The future timeline for this VR design will have multiple major expansion packs as well as extra in game features to be added. The expansion packs will be aimed to come out every four to five years.<p>

     <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
     <p>The game will be developed using Unreal Engine 5. Unreal Engine is a top choice for developing this game due to what can be achieved, it has photoreal rendering in real time, a robust multiplayer framework, VFX and particle simulation, advanced AI, film quality post-process effects, unreal audio engine and limitless extensibility.</p>

      <h2>Skills Required</h2>
      <p>There are several skills that will be required to make this game for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming – In charge of developing the code required for the game, developing a website and the creation of the installer. They will need a basic knowledge about scripts and C++ programming language.</li>
        <li>Sounds – Responsible for music, sound effects and overall audio for the game.</li>
        <li>Design – In charge of maintaining, updating the game design and connecting all the various parts of the project.</li>
        <li>Quality assurance – Responsible for playing the game in order to find bugs, glitches and any other issues. This task can be done in house or done by beta testers.</li>
        <li>Business – In charge of the games marketing, sales, subscriptions and funding.</li>
        <li>Art - They will oversee the visual elements you will see while playing the game and making sure they meet the specifications.</li>
        <li>Project management – Oversees the overall game development, making sure each team knows the task at hand and the time frame allocated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>Firstly, just achieving the game development would be a great success but the outcome of the project’s success would have a great impact on the gaming comm world-wide. In saying this the success would not only be determined by the games release but by how well the game impacts the gaming community. Objectively the best outcome would have the game as the number one game sold and be able to maintain that sort of player base. I think that being a Virtual Reality MMORPG the outcome of releasing such a game would have a big impact on the gaming world today.</p>
      <p> If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</p>
