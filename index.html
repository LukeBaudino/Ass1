      <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Townsville. During year 11 I got a school-based Apprenticeship as a Heavy Vehicle Mechanic
        while finishing my remainder years of school.I went on to complete my Apprenticeship and in 2015 I joined the
        Australian Army as a Vehicle Mechanic which gave me the opportunity to move around the country.</p>
      <p>Growing up I was big into playing sport mostly soccer, I played it for 10 years of my childhood.
         I stopped playing soccer when I started working full time as a Mechanic. As I got older my interest
         in Gaming grew (mostly online gaming) and now it is one of my main hobbies.</p>

      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>Growing up technology has advanced and became a lot more of my everyday life, just about everything is done or can be done online. If I could go back knowing technology would be like this, then I would have chosen a career in IT after school.
         Towards the end of my Army career, I decided that I wanted a change of careers and since I spend a lot of time on computers and the way the world is going, I thought I would try and pursue a career in IT.
         I have very limited experience in IT but the main reason for wanting to do IT is to be able to fix and rectify tech problems around me.</P>
      <p>Transitioning out of the Army I had no knowledge on Uni whatsoever. I had spoken to a JCU representative at a transition seminar, and they were able to tell me what I needed to be able to study for a Bachelor of IT.
         I signed up with Open Universities Australia with the interest of studying for my Bachelor of IT and since I have no previous history of studying, they suggested that I try out a single subject to see what I think and how I go with it.
         I chose this course because it will help me with starting off my studies for the bachelor and I wanted to do this all online which is why I chose RMIT.</P>
      <p>Over the years I got used to being thrown in the deep end when it came to courses. However, this course started at a nice steady pace. Coming into this course I was expecting to
         learn the basics of how to identify and fix certain tech problems. If I can leave this course with a basic knowledge of IT and a better understanding of it all then I have achieved the goal that I wanted from this course.</p>

      <h1>Personality Profile</h1>
      <h2>Myers Briggs Type Indercator</h2>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <p>Creative – Advocates aren’t exactly like everyone else – and that’s a wonderful thing. People with this personality type embrace their creative side, always on the lookout for opportunities to express themselves and think outside the box.</p>
      <p>Insightful – These personalities know all too well that appearances can be misleading. Advocates strive to move beyond superficiality and seek out the deeper truths in life. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs.</p>
      <p>Principled – Advocates tend to have strong beliefs and values, particularly when it comes to matters of ethics. When Advocates talk about topics close to their heart, their conviction and heartfelt idealism can inspire and persuade even the sternest of skeptics.</p>
      <p>Passionate – Advocates crave a sense of purpose in life. Rather than living on autopilot or sticking to the status quo, they want to chase after their ideals. This isn’t a personality type that shies away from big dreams – in fact, Advocates are energized and impassioned by the beauty of their visions for the future.</p>
      <p>Altruistic – People with this personality type aren’t happy to succeed at another person’s expense. Advocates want to use their strengths for the greater good, and they rarely lose sight of how their words and actions might affect others. In their heart of hearts, they want to make the world a better place, starting with the people around them.</p>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <p>Sensitive to Criticism – Advocates aren’t averse to feedback – that is, unless they believe that someone is challenging their most cherished principles or values. When it comes to the issues that are near and dear to them, people with this personality type can become defensive or dismissive.</p>
      <p>Reluctant to Open Up – Advocates value honesty and authenticity, but they’re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles, not wanting to burden someone else with their issues. Unfortunately, when Advocates don’t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships.</p>
      <p>Perfectionistic – The Advocate personality type is all but defined by idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, it doesn’t always leave room for the messiness of real life. Advocates might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships if they’re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they should be looking for something better.</p>
      <p>Avoiding the Ordinary – Advocates yearn to do extraordinary things with their lives. But it’s hard to achieve anything extraordinary without breaking it down into small, manageable steps. Unless they translate their dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists, Advocates may struggle to turn their grand visions into reality.</p>
      <p>Prone to Burnout – Advocates’ perfectionism and reserve leave them with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type can exhaust themselves if they don’t balance their drive to help others with necessary self-care and rest.</p>

     <p>Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:
     <ul>
       <li>Sit near the front of the classroom.</li>
       <li>Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.</li>
       <li>Use flashcards to learn new words.</li>

     <h2>Team Role Test</h2>

     <h3>Your team roles</h3>

        The nine team roles are the Executive, Explorer, Innovator, Analyst, Driver, Chairperson, Completer, Team player and Expert.
        A total of 100 points are divided over the various roles. A group role can have up to 25 points. The graph below shows how each team role fits you. After the graph, each team role is explained in detail, in the order of its importance to you.</p>

     <p>Analyst - The analyst tends to be reserved and critical. The analyst will also react to plans and ideas in a rational and sensible way. He or she will favour a prudent approach to matters and will evaluate them according to their accuracy before acting.</p>
     <p>Executive - The executive is sometimes also referred to as the organizer. The executive is generally disciplined and eager to get the job done. He or she is efficient, practical, and systematic. Executives are well organized and diligent, and quickly turn the ideas of a team into concrete actions and practical plans.</p>
     <p>Innovator - The innovator is often the creative generator of a team. He or she has a strong imagination and a desire to be original. The innovator prefers to be independent and tends to approach tasks in a scientific way. As a creative individual the innovator may play a crucial role in the way a team approaches tasks and solves problems.</p>
     <p>Chairperson - The chairperson has a strong coordinating role. With an emphasis on procedures, the chairperson will try to bring and keep the team together. He or she is communicative and deals with the members of the team in a respectful and open-minded way.</p>

Completers are concerned when errors are made, and they tend to worry because of their controlling nature.

     <h1>Project Idea</h1>
     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>The project is to create a virtual reality multiplayer online role-playing game. This will provide a more realistic experience for gamers who play multiplayer online role-playing games and will revolutionise how we play online. The game that I would like to create would be based off the light novel and anime series Sword Art Online.</p>

     <h2>Motivation</h2>
     <p>I have a passion for playing multiplayer online role-playing games, the social aspect of it and just getting lost in a fantasy world where you can be and do just about anything. Ever since I saw the Anime Sword Art Online, I have always dreamed of one day being able to play a virtual reality multiplayer online role-playing game. It would be a great achievement to be part of the development for such a game. Currently to date there are around 3 billion people in the world that play video games, so I think something like this will be the next best thing.</p>
