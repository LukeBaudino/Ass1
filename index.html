      <h1>Personal Information</h1>

      <p>I was born and raised in Townsville. During year 11 I got a school-based Apprenticeship as a Heavy Vehicle Mechanic
        while finishing my remainder years of school.I went on to complete my Apprenticeship and in 2015 I joined the
        Australian Army as a Vehicle Mechanic which gave me the opportunity to move around the country.</p>
      <p>Growing up I was big into playing sport mostly soccer, I played it for 10 years of my childhood.
         I stopped playing soccer when I started working full time as a Mechanic. As I got older my interest
         in Gaming grew (mostly online gaming) and now it is one of my main hobbies.</p>

      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>Growing up technology has advanced and became a lot more of my everyday life, just about everything is done or can be done online. If I could go back knowing technology would be like this, then I would have chosen a career in IT after school.
         Towards the end of my Army career, I decided that I wanted a change of careers and since I spend a lot of time on computers and the way the world is going, I thought I would try and pursue a career in IT.
         I have very limited experience in IT but the main reason for wanting to do IT is to be able to fix and rectify tech problems around me.</P>
      <p>Transitioning out of the Army I had no knowledge on Uni whatsoever. I had spoken to a JCU representative at a transition seminar, and they were able to tell me what I needed to be able to study for a Bachelor of IT.
         I signed up with Open Universities Australia with the interest of studying for my Bachelor of IT and since I have no previous history of studying, they suggested that I try out a single subject to see what I think and how I go with it.
         I chose this course because it will help me with starting off my studies for the bachelor and I wanted to do this all online which is why I chose RMIT.</P>
      <p>Over the years I got used to being thrown in the deep end when it came to courses. However, this course started at a nice steady pace. Coming into this course I was expecting to
         learn the basics of how to identify and fix certain tech problems. If I can leave this course with a basic knowledge of IT and a better understanding of it all then I have achieved the goal that I wanted from this course.</p>
